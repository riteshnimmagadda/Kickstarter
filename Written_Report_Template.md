# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This kickstarter analysis project aims to analyze the historic trends of the campaign on various dimensions including but not limited to funding, release periods and play categories.

### Purpose
The purpose of this data analysis project is to identify the correlation between program launch dates, funding goals and categories of a kickstarter campaign.This correlative analysis can be used as an historic trend for forecasting any such campaigns in the future.

## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
While it is clear to say that there aren't many cancellations, the percent success and failurs clearly have a correlation excepting for the month of november. Also it is quite evident that there is a steep increase in success rate starting end of spring begning into summer, however that has a down trend thereafter. The success rates for the campaign had always been higher versus the failure excepting towards the end of the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
there has been a lot of volatality between the success percentage and failure percentage across all the funding goal categories. It is however important to note that the failure percentage is greater towards the higher funding goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Only challenge i faced during this project is that the Year column that was created wasn't copying down the formula as i double click on the cell. I had to manually drag the forumula to the end of the sheet. I googled for a reason, but wasn't able to find an answer

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	- Success and failure have a correlation for most period of the year
	- the number of events canceled are almost negligible compared to the success number

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	- There is an inverse relation between success and failure across different funding goals
	- percentage of events canceled are zero

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	- this dateset doesnt take into account the demographics of the players.
	- also this dataset dosent describe why an event is a failure versus success

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	- an illustration between the parent category and outcomes may give us an insight of most popular category and if that could have been plotted against the age group of the users, it could give an impression of which category to be targetted against which audiance instead of just realying on the time of the year.
